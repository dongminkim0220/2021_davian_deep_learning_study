## ConvNets

* ConvNets are used everywhere such as
  * Classification
  * Image Retrieval
  * Detection
  * Segmentation
  * Pose recognition
  * etc
* ConvNet is a sequence of Convolution Layers and each filter produces an activation map. 
* Each layer features an image in hierarchal way.
  
    i.e.
  * First layer extracts low-level features such as color and intensity.
  * Second layer extracts mid-level features such as shape of objects.
  * Third layer extracts high-level features such as parts of objects.
  * Object classes generated after go through all layers.

## Fully Connected Layer

* Input: Stretch a 32 x 32 x 3 image to 3072 x 1 vector.
* Weight: Size of number of classes which will be 10 x 3072 matrix.
* Output: Output will be dot product of input and weight matrix which is 1 x 10.

    10 neuron outputs will be generated. 

## Convolution Layer

* Parameters
  * W: width, H: height, D: depth
  * K: Number of filter
  * F: Size of filter
  * S: Stride
  * P: Amount of padding
* The size of the input preserved as original spatial structure W x H x D. 
* The filter slides over the original size of W x H x D image by computing dot products.

    * Output size: (N - F)/S + 1 where N is size of input image.
  
    â€» The depth of the filter must be same as input depth.
  
  i.e. 2D convolution) 5 x 5 input with 3 x 3 filter with stride = 1 -> 3 x 3 output

* Padding makes the output to be same as input size by padding dummy on the border such as zeros.

    * Output size: [(W - F + 2P)/S + 1] x [(H - F + 2P)/S + 1] x D
    * Number of parameters: (F x F x D + 1) x K where 1 is bias
* Purposes of padding
  * To preserve spatial structure.
  * To use data at corners.
  
  i.e. Padding) 5 x 5 input with 3 x 3 filter with stride = 1 and Pad = 1 -> 5 x 5 output

## Advantage of Convolution Layer

----

1. Spatial structure

* FC Layer ignores spatial structure by flattening all pixels in 1 dimension while Convolution Layer preserve the spatial structure with depth, stride, and padding.
* So, it has advantage of training objects like image data accurately.

2. Parameter sharing
 
  ![Parameter_sharing](https://github.com/wdy964/2021_davian_deep_learning_study/blob/master/posts/images/Parameter%20sharing.png?raw=true)

* Thus, the number of parameters in a conv layer reduced through parameter sharing from 105,415,600 to 34,944 in this example.
* The number of weight updates during backpropagation reduced by parameter sharing and therefore, the training time reduced.

## Pooling Layer

* Pooling layer downsamples the activation map.
* Filter convolve the feature map and pooling representative value.
  
  i.e) 2 x 2 Filter with stirde =2
![Pooling](https://www.bouvet.no/bouvet-deler/understanding-convolutional-neural-networks-part-1/_/attachment/inline/e60e56a6-8bcd-4b61-880d-7c621e2cb1d5:6595a68471ed37621734130ca2cb7997a1502a2b/Pooling.gif)
 
 * Therefore, spatial structure preserved and computational complexity reduced.
